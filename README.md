# College_Registration
Object-Oriented Java (Lets Give it a try)

I tried a object oriented java. This is a college registration system where a person class is the parent class and student and intructor
are the children class. The course class is allows teh student to enroll for the course.

The person class has some variables and methods such as firstname, lastname, address, email which a person must have and it extends in the 
student as well as instructor class, Which is having the main course information.There are various methods for student and instructor. The 
course class has some methods to see whether the student fits in the class and whether the instructor is allowed to teach that course.
